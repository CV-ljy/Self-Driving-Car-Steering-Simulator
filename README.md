# **Self-Driving Car Steering Simulator**

This is a Self-Driving Car steering simulator based on Sully Chen's [model](https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow/blob/master/model.py) of the NVIDIA End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf).

### Model
The model has five convolutional layers, four fully connected layers and one output layer. It applies dropout in all of the fully connected layers
